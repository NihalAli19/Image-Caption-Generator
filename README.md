# Image Caption Generator

## Introduction
The image caption generator project aims to develop a system that automatically generates captions for images using natural language processing techniques. This technology has a wide range of applications, including assisting visually impaired individuals and medical image analysis.

## Goals and Objectives
- Develop an image processing pipeline to extract meaningful features from images.
- Implement a natural language processing model to generate captions based on extracted features.
- Evaluate and optimize the system for accuracy, speed, and scalability.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional image caption generator system capable of producing accurate captions.
- Fully functional code and outputs
- Prediction Graph
- Image classifier
- Project Report
- Streamlit for GUI
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Scope of Work
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather a diverse dataset of images with corresponding captions. Preprocess the images to standardize size, format, and quality.
- **Feature Extraction:** Use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract relevant features from images. Fine-tune the CNNs for better feature representation.
- **Caption Generation Model:** Develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) for generating captions. Train the model using the preprocessed image-caption dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as BLEU score.
- **Optimization:** Fine-tune the model and optimize the image processing pipeline for faster inference and improved accuracy.
