# Image Caption Generator

## Introduction
The **Image Caption Generator** project is designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. This system integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM layers for generating natural language captions. This project has practical applications in aiding visually impaired individuals, enhancing image-based search, and more.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Image Processing Pipeline:** Develop a robust pipeline to extract meaningful features from images using a pretrained VGG16 model.
- **Caption Generation:** Implement a natural language processing model to generate captions based on the extracted features.
- **Evaluation:** Assess and optimize the model for accuracy, speed, and scalability, using metrics such as BLEU score.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional image caption generator system capable of producing accurate captions.
- Complete source code, including training scripts, models, and example outputs.
- Feature extraction using VGG16 and caption generation using LSTM.
- A comprehensive project report.
- A user-friendly GUI developed with Tkinter.

## Scope of Work
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
  - Utilize the [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k?select=captions.txt), which contains a diverse collection of images with corresponding captions.
  - Preprocess the images to standardize size, format, and quality, and tokenize the captions.

- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Leverage the VGG16 model, pretrained on ImageNet, to extract high-level features from images.
  - Fine-tune the VGG16 model to enhance feature representation.

- **Caption Generation Model:**
  - Develop an LSTM-based RNN to generate captions from the extracted image features.
  - Train the model on the preprocessed image-caption dataset, integrating VGG16 and LSTM.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Evaluate the model’s performance using the BLEU score to measure the quality of generated captions.
  - Optimize the model for better accuracy and faster inference times.
